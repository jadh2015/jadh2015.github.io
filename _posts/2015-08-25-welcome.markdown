With a week to go before the conference kick-off, in the name of the
local organizing team, I would like welcome all conference
participants to Kyoto.

While there is a Taifun raging through Japan at this moment, and also
bringing strong winds to Kyoto, but this will pass and the prospects
for next week are fine.  We expect high temperatures around 30°C, lows
about 22°C with occasional rainshowers.  Fortunately, the heat of the
summer has left early this year and in the mornings and evenings, the
crisp air already announces the coming of fall.

We hope all participants have a pleasant trip to Kyoto and a nice
stay.  **Please refer to this website for up-to-date information**  The
conference also has a twitter account @jadh2015, which will be
used to keep you posted of program changes and other important
information.

Looking forward to seeing you soon,

For the local organizing committee,  Christian Wittern
