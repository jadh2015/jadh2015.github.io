### Encoding Cultural Resources

[The Japanese Association for Digital Humanities](http://www.jadh.org/)
is pleased to announce its fifth annual conference, to be held at the
[Insitute for Research in Humanities](http://www.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/e/institute/access-institute/access_e.htm),
Kyoto University, Japan, September 1-3,
2015. 

While the digitization of cultural resources has been widely carried
out in Japan, it has been of only the most prized treasures and
providing basic metadata rather than full-text encoding of a wider
range of cultural resources. This situation has come about due to
several environmental difficulties, including issues of compatibility
of character encoding, lack of characters in the available character
encoding standards, weak IT literacy of humanities scholars,
and so on. However, because the environment for encoding various
cultural resources has gradually been improving, several projects have
begun to more deeply encode their resources. 

The aim of this conference is to encourage and support this trend. By
so doing, we hope to contribute to the spread of the application of
encoding in various stages and the critical engagement with digital
resources in the Humanities.
