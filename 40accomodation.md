## List of Hotels in Kyoto

  Kyoto is a very popular tourist destination, and there are many
  hotels in Kyoto catering to different groups of visitors.  Below is
  a small selection of places to stay we think we can recommend to
  you. Be sure to check out the pages of these hotels to find out
  which one will be the best fit for your expectations and budget.

  For access to the venue you will have to rely on public
  transportation or taxi, since there is no hotel in convenient walking distance
  of the University.  The closest train station is Demachiyanagi on the Keihan line.  
  
  Coming from the Kyoto Station area, take the subway to Imadegawa and
  change to Bus 201.  Buses are also available from the Imperial
  Palace area, a walk would be about 30mins, about the same is true
  for Sanjo area.
