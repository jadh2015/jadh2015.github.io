"Encoding Cultural Resources"

The Japanese Association for Digital Humanities is pleased to announce
its fifth annual conference, to be held at Kyoto University, Japan,
September 1-3, 2015. 

The conference will feature posters, papers and panels. We invite
proposals on all aspects of digital humanities globally, and
especially encourage papers treating topics that deal with practices
that aim to cross borders, for example, between academic fields,
media, languages, cultures, and so on, as related to the field of
digital humanities.

While the digitization of cultural resources has been widely carried
out in Japan, it has been of only the most prized treasures and
providing basic metadata rather than full-text encoding of a wider
range of cultural resources. This situation has come about due to
several environmental difficulties, including issues of compatibility
of character encoding, lack of characters in the available character
encoding standards, limitations in access to powerful computers,
narrow bandwidth of network, weak IT literacy of humanities scholars,
and so on. However, because the environment for encoding various
cultural resources has gradually been improving, several projects have
begun to more deeply encode their resources. To encourage and support
this trend, we welcome presentations of studies and examples that
treat the encoding of cultural resources in the field of digital
humanities, such as TEI, EAD, KML, ePub, HTML5, RDF, LOD and so on. By
so doing, we hope to contribute to the spread of the application of
encoding in various stages. With this as our suggested central focus,
we nonetheless welcome papers on a broad range of DH topics. For
example:

Research issues, including data mining, information design and
modeling, software studies, and humanities research enabled through
the digital medium; computer-based research and computer applications
in literary, linguistic, cultural and historical studies, including
electronic literature, public humanities, and interdisciplinary
aspects of modern scholarship. Some examples might include text
analysis, corpora, corpus linguistics, language processing, language
learning, and endangered languages; the digital arts, architecture,
music, film, theater, new media and related areas; the creation and
curation of humanities digital resources; the role of digital
humanities in academic curricula;

The range of topics covered by Digital Humanities can also be consulted in the journal
[Digital Scholarship in the Humanities](http://dsh.oxfordjournals.org/about), Oxford University Press.

The deadline for submission of abstracts has been extended to May 18, 2015. Presenters will be notified of acceptance on 30 May 2015 (late submitters by middle of June).

Please send abstracts to conf2015 [ at ] jadh.org by May 7, 2015.

Type of proposals:

1. Poster presentations
Poster presentations may include work-in-progress on any of the topics described above as well as demonstrations of computer technology, software and digital projects. A separate poster session will open the conference, during which time presenters should be on-hand to explain their work, share their ideas with other delegates, and answer questions. Posters will also be on displayed at various times during the conference, and presenters are encouraged to provide material and handouts with more detailed information and URLs.

2. Short papers
Short papers are allocated 10 minutes (plus 5 minutes for questions) and are suitable for describing work-in-progress and reporting on shorter experiments and software and tools in early stages of development.

3. Long papers
Long papers are allocated 20 minutes (plus 10 minutes for questions) and are intended for presenting substantial unpublished research and reporting on significant new digital resources or methodologies.

4. Panels Panels (90 minutes) are comprised of either: 
(a) Three long
  papers on a joint theme. All abstracts should be submitted together
  with a statement, of approximately 750 words, outlining the session
  topic and its relevance to current directions in the digital
  humanities; or 
  (b) A panel of four to six speakers. The panel
  organize should submit a 750-words outline of the topic session and
  its relevance to current directions in the digital humanities as
