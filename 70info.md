## Paper and Panel Sessions

A LCD projector will be available in the conference room for the presentations. Please bring your laptop if you plan to present your slides. If you can't bring your laptop, please contact us (jadh2015.contact [AT] jadh.org). Moreover, if your presentation uses audio and/or video, please let us know beforehand. If your laptop is a Mac, please make sure to bring its adapter to VGA.
Please make sure your time and place of your paper presentation are shown on the timetable and come to the conference room at the break time before your session in order to confirm the connection between the projector and your laptop.

Chairs of each paper session will be assigned soon. In the case of panel sessions, someone in the panel should moderate the session.
