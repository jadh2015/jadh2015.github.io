### Workshop 1: Old Photo Hunting in Kyoto

* Title : Old Photo Hunting in Kyoto - Discovering Historical Landscape in
the Open Air
* Time : 13:00-17:00
* Venue : small room (30 seats)
* Language : English

This workshop is a unique opportunity to walk in the town of
Kyoto and discover historical landscape using our mobile app
"MemoryHunt." The workshop starts in the room with a short
introduction of the app. Participants then move outside to walk around
the town to compare the current landscape with the historical
landscape in old photographs. Taking photographs with the app is not
just sightseeing but contribution to the cultural archive with spatial
and visual annotation. The workshop ends in the room with discussion
on results of the activity and future of the project.

#### Note :
The mobile app is only available for Android. The organizer will
prepare one or two Android smart phones, but those without Android
devices may have a limited experience on the app.

The workshop program is subject to change due to weather conditions.
Severe weather may lead to an indoor-only program.

Please be well prepared for walking outside in various weather
conditions. The average of the highest temperature at Kyoto is 31.6
degree Celsius (88.9 degree Fahrenheit) on September 1.

The workshop fee does not include public transportation and other fees
that may be required.  To register, please go to [[Payment]({{ site.baseurl }}/payment/)] and include the fee for the workshop in your payment.

This project will be presented on September 2 with the title
"MemoryHunt: A Mobile App with an Active Viewfinder for Crowdsourced
Annotation through the Re-experience of the Photographer." The project
website is [MemoryHunt - Mobile App for Hunting the Place of Memories](http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/memory-hunting/)
